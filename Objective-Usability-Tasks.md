# Objective Usability Tasks

The primary goal of our prototype is to test our persona's user journey to book a hotel.
We believe from our research that Emily (persona) will use her mobile device to research and eventually book accommodations.
We hypothesis that Emily uses her phone during down time at work to research accommodations.  
At home she uses a tablet to review hotel images and ammenties.
Emily travels with her family and she wants a place that fits her families needs.

Taniti wants to promote local hotels and encourage tourists to visit
