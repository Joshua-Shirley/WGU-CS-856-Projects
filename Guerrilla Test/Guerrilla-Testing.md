## The Survey / Test

User picks out path to get to the hotel profile.

Choices 
1. Menu -> Map -> Map to Select Hotel -> Hotel Profile
2. Menu -> Hotel List -> Hotel Profile
3. Menu -> House List -> House Profile

## Summarize the Qualitative Feedback

Canidates feedback was to simplify the choices.  
One list and one Map.
Canidates looked for a list filter which wasn't there.


## Design Improvements from Feedback

- It was determined that the hotels and houses should be combined into one.
- Filters need to be added to the hotel list.
- Add in touch events to accommodate touch screens
