## Summarize the Qualitative Feedback

Canidates feedback was to simplify the choices.    
One list and one Map.  
Canidates looked for a list filter which wasn't there.  
House list is not neccessary.


## Design Improvements from Feedback

- It was determined that the hotels and houses should be combined into one.  
- Filters need to be added to the hotel list.  
- Add in touch events to accommodate touch screens.
